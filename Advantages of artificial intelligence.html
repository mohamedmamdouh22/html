<h3>Benefits of AI</h3>
<BR>
<BR>
<h4> 1- Automates the processes:</h4>
Artificial Intelligence allows robots to develop repetitive, routine and process optimization tasks automatically and without human intervention.
 <BR>
<h4>2- Enhance creative tasks:</h4> AI frees people from routine and repetitive tasks and allows them to spend more time on creative functions
<h4>3- Provides precision:</h4>The application of AI is capable of providing greater precision than humans, for example in industrial environments, 
machines can make decisions that were previously made manually or monitored without AI.
 <BR>

<h4>4- Reduces human error:</h4>AI reduces failures caused by human limitations. In some production lines, AI is used to detect, by means of infrared sensors, small cracks or defects in parts that are undetectable by the human eye.
 <BR>

<h4>5- Reduces time spent on data analysis:</h4> It allows the analysis and exploitation of the data derived from production to be carried out in real time.
 <BR>

<h4>6- Predictive maintenance:</h4> It allows to carry out a maintenance of the industrial equipment based on the times and conditions of operation of the same, allowing to increase its performance and life cycle
